| J48 | Display |
| J43 | PMOD |
| J23 | UART1 (1 GND, 2 RX, 3 TX)|
| J24 | UART2/SWO (1 GND, 2 RX, 3 TX/SWCLK, 4 SWDIO) |

TPH1R405PL - very high current, around 200A (in THEORY!) - check the specs of the screw terminals instead, they'll catch fire (24A max).
AON7524 - high current, around 20A - still borderline depending on the screw terminals.
ECP5 - directly connected to the FPGA (with series resistor, 220R), 4/8/12/16mA depending on bitstream, use with care.

### Jumpers

| Name | Function |
| ---- | -------- |
| JP5, JP6, JP7, JP8, JP9, JP10 | VM1/VM2 switch |
| JP16 | Bridges Vaux and VM1 (if closed)* |
| JP1 | Close to enable local 5V generation |
| JP3 | Vaux (1-2) or 5V (2-3) for PWM 5-8 |
| JP2 | 5V (1-2) or 3.3V (2-3) for PWM 9-10 |
| JP4 | 5V (1-2) or 3.3V (2-3) for PWM 12-13 |
| JP11 | 5V (1-2) or 3.3V (2-3) for Endstop 1-6 |
| JP12 | 5V (1-2) or 3.3V (2-3) for Endstop 7-8 |
| JP13 | FPGA boot configuration |
| JP14 | FPGA boot configuration |
| JP15 | FPGA boot configuration |
| J22 | STM32 bootloader enable if closed |
* = If you want to bridge Vaux and VM1 - connect the power to Vaux instead (wider traces and you don't end up putting all the power through JP5 - which can handle 2-3A). Ideally, connect both, VM1 and Vaux directly to the PSU.
